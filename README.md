# Payment_Application_Project
payment application system 
This project simulates the interaction between the user(as bank client) and the terminal(as the Automatic Teller Machine ATM)
when trying to process a SALE transacion and give a feedback wheather the transaction is approved or the reason why it is declined if it isn't approved.
